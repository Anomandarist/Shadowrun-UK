### Berlin History:

Covers an idealized diameter of 65 km, surrounded by a wall
No spot within the city lies more than two hundred meters away from a U-Bahn entrance. The star-shaped Ubahn network created more than one hundred years ago still operates, supplemented by a second network constructed in 2009, fifty meters below the first one.
After the reunification, Berlin was given a federal government-like city council and all of the districts were given semi-autonomus powers. Each of the districts selects a representative for the council. The districts are split between so-called alternative districts, mostly eastern district that used to be anarchists and the corporate district, mostly made of the previously western district controlled by the corporations.

#### Timeline
###### 2033
Nightwraith incident Jan 2033 brought end to Euro-wars. Berlin occupied largely with German, Polish and Russian forces throughout year left to reinforce borders in Balkans and border with Turkey. Amidst chaos many minorities and metahumans settled in Berlin, Rhine-Ruhr megaplex and Hamburg.

###### 2038
Berlin largely left neglected by wider German state and social and political war raged within the streets. Secession of German Lander in 2038 amplified this.
Early in 2038, a few radical, left-wing student organizations att he three Berlin universities organized massive strikes and protests to demand immediate improvement of teaching conditions and an end to exams they deemed unfair. Yhe university president tried to sit out the strike, but was forced to resort to tougher measures when his office received a package containing the severed ears of several professors who had earned the radical students' ire. He hired private security forces to clear occupied campus buildings, but these forces retreated after meeting defeat in several bloody skirmishes.
The escalating conflict in Berlin drew scores of political deviants to the city. Law abinding citizens reacted by moving out of Berlin to surrounding towns – now the Downlands.

###### 2039
Urban warfare becomes normal state of affairs. Following ‘Night of Rage’ February 2039 (https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Night_of_Rage) metahuman rebels allied with the cities anarchists to form the Berlin Anarchist Movement (Anarchistische Sewegung Berlin, ABB), clashing with the racist groups in a five day civil war, forcing both Humanis Polyclub and the acting mayor to abdicate. Rote Rathaus was burnt to the ground.
23 days of internal negotiations later the Berlin Flux State was created – all democratic laws were rescinded and anarchism made the basis of public life.
City services were handled by the newly formed, privitised Devoted Trust (Treusorgende Hand)
PdRA (The Partei der Radikalen Anarchie, or Party of Radical Anarchy) – most radical part of the ABB permitted no government structure of any kind. Such radical thoughts led to split within the ABB and developed them into the Neo-Anarchist Policlub (NAP)
New morals and dependencies developed alongside rejuvenated fashion trends and popular culture.Attracted by this new vitality, corporations began to invest in the city again, enlarging enclaves already present and founding new ones.

###### 2054
Berlin 2054 is influenced by megacorporate business but maintains political freedom.
Berlin's anarchist groups work to keep the power structure in a constant state of change. Whenever a shift in the power structure seems likely to establish a status quo, the rest of Berlin's powers that be spring into action to eliminate the threat. Any individual or group recognized as Bedrohung des Status F (BSF), or a threat to the F-State, immediately attracts the efforts of all other groups in Berlin to strip it of its power

###### 2055
The anarchist rule lasted until 2055 when joint corporate forces, acting on orders of the German government (AGS), invaded the city and, after weeks of fighting, forced the surviving anarchists to retreat to the eastern part of the city that was later walled off.
###### 2060
Anarchists and corporations signed a truce in 2060 and Berlin was separated into the small anarchist east (surrounded by walls and heavily guarded by corporate forces) and the large corporate west (divided into sectors each controlled by a corporation).
###### 2072
An attack on EMC in Berlin's Köbenick district on April 14, 2072, allegedly committed by UV-X, also used Surtr nanites, even though the majority of released nanobots were actually harmless, reprogrammed medo-nanites.
In 2072, a sprawl guerilla cell called UV-X detonated the Surtr nanoweapon (full notes at end of document) in an attack. This provided casus belli to the corporations for finally ending the anarchist rule in Berlin. Corporate forces quickly captured the anarchist-ruled part of Berlin with relatively few casualties. After the reunification, Berlin was given a federal government-like city council and all of the districts were given semi-autonomus powers. Each of the districts selects a representative for the council.
After the liberation of the eastern sectors, the Berlin contract with the ADL of 2055 was fundamentally revised and revised. In the course of this drastic transformation, Königs Wusterhausen was returned to Brandenburg, while others were incorporated to Brandenburg parts of the Berlin countryside. The number of districts in Berlin was reduced to 21 as part of a new draw of the district boundaries. The group council was transformed into a constitutional body of district representatives as the "Berlin Council", while the administration of the city is the responsibility of Berlin Verwaltungs AG (BERVAG). The district autonomy or autocracy represents a core of the new order of Berlin. For example, in the new "Berlin Council" representatives of the extraterritorial corporate districts sit nominally on an equal footing with the democratically elected district representatives of the Freie Bezirke and the representatives of the alternative districts whose forms of government are anarchist and communist rich to meritocratic cityscape.
