# Initiative

- Encounters are divided into 3s COMBAT TURNS
- Combat turns are divided into INITIATIVE PASSES
- Initiative Passes are divided into each character's ACTION PHASE
- Initiative is rolled at the start of each combat turn to determine the order in which characters act and how many passes they get to perform

## Roll INITIATIVE

- Initiative consists of a static modifier + a number of d6s.
- It is dependent on the environment the character is occupying.


Initiative Type | Attributes | Base Initiative Dice
--------------- |:----------:|:--------------------:|
Physical | REA + INT | 1d6
Astral | INT x2 | 2d6
Matrix AR | REA + INT | 1d6
Matrix Cold VR | Data Processing + INT | 3d6
Matrix Hot VR | Data Processing + INT | 4d6
Rigging AR | REA + INT | 1d6

- Characters act in initiative order
- In the case of a tie use ERIC (Edge, Reaction, Intuition, Coin Toss)
- Wound penalties affect the static initiative modifier and are applied immediately.
	- This includes changing the characters initiative for the current combat turn.
- If a characters initiative changes, apply the difference to the static modifier immediately.
- This also occurs if the number of initiative dice changes
	- Additional dice are rolled and the sum added to the current initiative
	- If dice are lost, roll a number of dice equal to the difference and subtract this from the current initiative.

## Use of Edge
- Seize the Initiative : You go first for an entire combat turn, regardless of rolled initiative. If multiple characters Seize the Initiative they all go at the top of the initiative order, in order of initiative, followed by everyone else.
- Blitz : Roll 5d6 for your initiative this combat turn.

- At the end of each initiative pass,  -10 from every character's initiative.
- Characters with an initiative >0 may act again in a following initiative pass.
- This continues until all characters have an initiative of 0 or less.
- Characters with 0 or less initiative may take 1 free action per initiative pass.
