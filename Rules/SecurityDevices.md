# Landscaping

- Make it difficult for unauthorised people to enter without being spotted, trapped, intercepted, or killed
- Prevent intruder from escaping easily
- Trees, dense brush, and hedges can provide cover for sensors, wires, cameras, tiger pits, secret entrances or exits, or automated gun systems
- Ponds and lakes
- Dense brush and ground cover difficult to bypass without creating noise and may be paired with acoustic sensors
- Foliage affects Matrix Noise

# Barriers

- Prevent entry, escaping, deter surveillance, deter terrorist attacks
- Climbing past fencetop wiring: Climbing + AGI (3) Test, otherwise take damage
- Damage resisted by BOD + Armour
- Perception Test to spot the fence is non-standard
