title: Tracking
---
- Tracking a person or critter requires INT + Tracking [Mental]
	- Threshold is based on the terrain
- If target is actively obscuring their trail, this is an opposed test
	- INT + Tracking [Mental] vs AGI + Sneaking [Physical]
- Net hits on tracking roll can be used to gain additional information such as number of people, type of critter or age of the tracks
	- In urban tracking additional hits can be used to identify local crowd movement patterns, relevant cameras and AR clues
